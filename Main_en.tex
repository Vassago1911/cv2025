\aboutme{
As a PhD in mathematics, I enjoy models doing complex calculations. In Business Intelligence and 
Data Science others mostly see the results in form of KPIs.\\[2pt]
Typical examples are:
Good targeting for marketing, product comparisons from different suppliers, good predictions, whether
customers will buy or soon cancel a subscription.\\[4pt]

Specifically I enjoy my work most, if it enables people to have well informed
discussions and decisions with an "aha!" moment.

\section{My Business Stations}\\
\begin{twenty}
  \twentyitem
    {2023 - }
    {Freelance Data Science}
    {}
    {App-User Clusters, scraping lead lists, matching users}
  \twentyitem
    {2023}
    {Business Intelligence Manager}
    {ClaraVital, Hamburg}
    {\begin{itemize}
    \item Classification of shop articles for expected storage time. (SQL Server)
    \item Extraction of address lists for postcard mailing campaigns. (SQL, python)
    \end{itemize}}
  \twentyitem
    {2019 - 2022}
    {Data Science Consultant}
    {elbformat, Hamburg}
    {\begin{itemize}
    \item Migration of an aged intranet corpus of articles: 60.000 articles with only 6.000 still
          relevant to users, which resulted in a substantial reduction of needed work and 
          simplification for user search. (Python, SQL, Matomo tracking, scraping)
    \item A very lean chat bot for a school app to help pupils with reading trouble. The bot helps
          the teachers administrate the reading class with the app.
    \item Education of 3 junior Data scientists (python, SQL, sklearn, pandas, numpy, Tableau)
    \end{itemize}}
  \twentyitem
    {2016 - 2019}
    {Business Intelligence Analyst / Lead}
    {AppLike GmbH, Hamburg}
    {\begin{itemize}
    \item Automatic business reporting for the whole team in the morning (node.js, google sheets, 
    integration of various partner APIs) for a daily overview of cost and revenue as feedback to our
    activity.
    \item Tech-Support for all tracking URLs in marketing and sales (HTTP, REST, querystring magic),
    so business partners as well as colleagues could measure the effectiveness of campaigns accurately.
    \item Ad hoc analyses, "Impact Plots" for business teams (python, jupyter, sql, google sheets, 
    APIs) to have individual success/failure factors in just one easy image.
    \item Good and robust Revenue / LTV production reducing costs and enabling planning (APIs, sklearn,
    python, SQL). As a result the marketing campaigns were running with 40\% margin
    share (before: 20\%) with immediate revenue increase.
    \item Conducted the interviews and onboarding for Junior BI Analysts (google sheets, python, sql).
    \item Advised a master thesis which built bots to test our apps (python, functional 
    analysis, machine learning, algorithmics).
    \end{itemize}}

\section{.. and now?}\\
I've done quite a bit to interest people in products. I'd like to do more to understand
users enough so they also like to stay. There's a lot of business use still to be gained
from \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix_Prize}{classic methods} like recommendation engines,
e.g. by increasing the problem dimension strategically.

But if someone were to contract and feedback me as a junior game level designer, who likes to 
automate stuff, I'd be very curious, too :D
